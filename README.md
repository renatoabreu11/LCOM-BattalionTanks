# LCOM
Repository to host Computer Laboratory project.

LCOM is a course given at FEUP in the second year of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering.
 
## Battalion Tanks

The goal of this project was to develop a program/game that could demonstrate our proficiency on Hardware interface level programming, system-level programs and programming software tools. 

As such, we choose to develop a game based on [Tank Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Battalion). This allowed us to successfuly incorporate most peripherals studied throughout the semester and polish our knowledge about them.
